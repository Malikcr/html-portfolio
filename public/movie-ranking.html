<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO MALI</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies or series of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. ONE PIECE</h3>

<p>This is my very favourite Manga and Anime. The Story, the charakters, the animation of the series, everything of it makes me have	goosebumps.</p>

<h3>2. JOHN WICK</h3>

<p>John Wick is my favourite Hollywood Movie. I like the scenes in which John Wick seems to be a invincible enemy for his opponents. I love it how he gets angry, because someone killed his dog and stealed his car. In the first Movie he gets through his enemies until the last one was defeated.</p>

<h3>3. RAB NE BANA DI JODI</h3>

<p>This movie is my favourite Bollywood Movie. I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. I like his artist skills, and how he put emotions in very different and difficult scenes. In this movie he puts so much emotions in his role as a office guy called Surinda Sahni. This is a little different to my other favourites, because here isn't any action in this movie. I just love it because of the emotions that are conveyed to the viewer of this movie.</p>
